## Introduction

Welcome to the CP1404 Practicals repository. This repository contains all the practical exercises completed as part of the CP1404 subject at James Cook University.

My name is Gerard Pandji, and I am a student at James Cook University.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this subject, I have learned several important lessons about clean code:

- **Meaningful Names**: Choosing meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class and function should have a single responsibility, making the code more modular and easier to debug.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Consistent code formatting and indentation improve the readability of the code and make it easier to follow.
